    "# Exceptions and Error Handling in Java\n",

    "When an exception occurs we say it has been \"*thrown*\" and in Java the throwing of an exception creates an object which can be passed to a __catch__ block (that's a piece of code designed to be run if a specified error is thrown, it allows you more control over execution). In Java there are three main types of objects which can be *thrown* and all are derived from a superclass `Throwable`:\n",
    "- `Error`: these are typically external, unchecked errors and are automatically thrown to the calling method\n",
    "- `RuntimeException`: normally caused by programming mistakes (typos, missing syntax etc), these are also unchecked and automatically thrown to the calling method\n",
    "- `Exception`: these errors must be checked which means the exception must be explicitly thrown to the calling method or caught by a `try`/`catch` block\n",

The `sayHello` method calls an `preferredGreeting` method in turn calls an `obtainName` method and so on. This sequence from origin point to endpoint is the __call stack__. Each method call returns its result to the method that called it. So `obtainName` passes its return back to `preferredGreeting` which returns to `sayHello` etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an exception is not __caught__ it will be passed up the call stack in much the same way that a successful execution's result would be albeit with an exception object. If an exception *is* caught it will be thrown to the applicable catch block rather than running back up the call stack."

    "The main characteristics of OOP are:\n",
    "- modularity: the code for an object can be written/maintained independently of the code for other objects. After it's created an object can easily be passed around inside the system.\n",
    "- information-hiding: interacting with an objects methods only, the details of it's internals are hidden.\n",
    "- code re-use: if an object already exists it can be used in your program\n",
    "- pluggability and debugging ease: if a particular object has problems you can remove it and replace with a different object"

Additionally the dynamic class loading of Java allows code to be downloaded via the internet and executed."

Java on the other hand compiles to platform-independent Java bytecode. After the bytecode is created it's interpreted by a bytecode interpreter (the __J__ava __V__irtual __M__achine). In addition to the JVM, Java also needs a collection of standard Java class libraries. The JVM and class libraries are bundled together in the __J__ava __R__untime __E__nvironment."

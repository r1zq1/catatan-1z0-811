    "Each test class should be clearly named so that you (or any other developer) can easily tell what class the test is for. The test class name should be the name of the class its testing followed by the word \"Test\". For example if you have a class named `Car`, its test class should be named `CarTest`.\n",

    "The __main method__ is a special method that the JVM recognizes as the start point for every Java program which runs from the command line or a prompt. Thus any class that you need to run from CLI or prompt must have a main method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for the main method is very similar to the previously discussed method syntax. However, there are two *required* modifiers: `public` and `static`. Since the main method returns no values it has a return type of `void`. The name/identifer of the main method is `main`. The main method accepts zero or more objects of type `String`: `(String args[])`. This syntax allows you to type in values on the command line which will be used by your program while its running.\n",

    "The process of compilation converts the class files you write into bytecode that can be executed by the JVM. As noted previously, if your Java source files contains a public class, the source file must be named `[ClassName].java`. So, if we have a public `Car` class in its own file, and a test class for `Car` in its own file we should have two files:\n",

    "\n",

    "<br>`Car.class` and `CarTest.class`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you compile a class which references other objects, any classes for those objects which haven't yet been compiled will also be executed. So, if we'd compiled `CarTest.java` which references `Car.java` we should have both `.class` files."

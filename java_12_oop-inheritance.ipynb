    "Inheritance is the passing of attributes & actions from a parent __superclass__ to a child __subclass__. To do this you would create a subclass *from* a superclass. So, there would be a way for you to base the creation of a new class on an existing class."

    "## Overriding vs Overloading\n",
    "Two different but similar sounding words to note are:\n",
    "- __overriding__: changing the functionality of an existing, inherited method\n",
    "- __overloading__: creating multiple methods with the same name that accept different arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overriding\n",
    "Overriding a method is useful when you want to change the functionality of an existing method. Lets imagine you have a `Truck` subclass and a `Car` subclass both `extending` the `Vehicle` class. The `Vehicle` class provides a `horn()` method which we want to use but we'd like to change the sound. In our `Truck` subclass we __override__ the `horn()` method so it says *BEEP! BEEP!*. In our `Car` class we __override__ the `horn()` method so it says *meepmeep!*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overloading\n",
    "Overloading is useful if you want the same method to accept different arguments and output different results rather than defining multiple different methods. Lets imagine our `Truck` class has a `loadCargo()` method but we know our truck will be carrrying different types of cargo depending on the situation. We could define different methods like `loadColdCargo()`, `loadLiveCargo()`, `loadVolatileCargo()` and so on but it'd be a better user experience if we could have a single method. One way you could do so would be something like this:\n",

    "## What is OOP\n",
    "Object Oriented Programming is focused on the creation and interaction of *objects*. Some of the benefits of OOP are:\n",
    "- Modularity\n",
    "- The ability to hide information from the use (known as __information hiding__)\n",
    "- Code re-use\n",
    "- Improved debugging & testing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The basis of OOP are *classes* and *objects*. __Classes__ are essentially the blueprints for *objects*. __Objects__ in turn are collections of __attributes__ and __operations__ which are defined by the object's parent *Class*. *Attributes* usually contain a value representing the state of the attribute. *Operations* are actions carried out by the object and often make use of an attribute. For example, lets say we want to create a `clock` object. To do this we should consider the attributes and operations that make up a clock.\n",

    "        - __update_minutes__: every 60 seconds add `1` to `minute` attribute\n",
    "        - __update_hours__: every 60 minutes add `1` to `hour` attribute\n",

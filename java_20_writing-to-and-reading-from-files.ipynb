    "## Writing to a file\n",
    "To write to a file we're going to use several classes from the `java.io` package:\n",
    "- `File`: to instantiate a file type object which is a representation of a file for Java to work with.\n",
    "- `FileWriter`: a \"*convenience class*\" for writing characters to file.\n",
    "- `BufferedWriter`: a wrapper class that writes text to a \"character-output stream\", buffering characters to provide efficient writing.\n",
    "- `PrintWriter`: prints formatted representations of objects to a text-output stream.\n",
    "- `IOException`: to handle exceptions that may occur\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are so many classes needed to write to a file? [According to the API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/):\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>*In general, a Writer sends its output immediately to the underlying character or byte stream. Unless prompt output is required, it is advisable to wrap a BufferedWriter around any Writer whose write() operations may be costly, such as FileWriters and OutputStreamWriters. Without buffering, each invocation of a print() method would cause characters to be converted into bytes that would then be written immediately to the file, which can be very inefficient.*"
